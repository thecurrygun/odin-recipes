    <h2>Description Jack's Burger</h2>
    <p>Best burger in town. This juicy burger will make you want to eat as many as you can.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 fresh jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>4 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced white onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>Step 1: Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, roast the jalapeno peppers until blackened on all sides. Place in a plastic bag to sweat and loosen the blackened skin. Rub the skin off, then seed if desired, and chop.</ol>
    <ol>Step 2: In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the chopped jalapenos, ground beef, salt, pepper, egg, steak sauce, onion, hot pepper sauce, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and Fritos®. Divide into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.</ol>
    <ol>Step 3: Grill patties for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until well done. I always drink one beer, then flip, drink another beer, then remove from the grill and place on buns. Top each one with a slice of pepperjack cheese and pig out!

    </ol>
